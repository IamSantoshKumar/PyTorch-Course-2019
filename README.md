# PyTorch-Course-2019
My course work from the following Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/


This course covered a lot of material pertaining to PyTorch and computer vision applications. The notebooks in this repository increse in complexity according to the following order:


## Notebook #1: Tensor Operations

The purpose of this notebook was to learn/practice basic tensor operations in PyTorch. [a relative link](Tensor Operations - PyTorch.ipynb)
